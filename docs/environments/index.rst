Environments
============

Depending on Arm architecture and SoC capabilities, there may be different options for
implementing hardware-backed isolation for protecting security sensitive workloads and
their assets. The Trusted Services project decouples service related components from
any particular environment, enabling services to be deployed in different environments.
This section provides information about supported secure processing environments.
