Generic Threat Model
====================

The Generic Threat Model discusses an abstract physical Secure Partition and captures service independent security
related information like assets, threats, and mitigations.

This model serves as the foundation for assessing the security of any specific deployment involving one or more Trusted
Services.

Target evaluation
-----------------

In this threat model, the target of evaluation is the S-EL0 SPs part of the PSA RoT hosting a "generalized" trusted
service.

This evaluation is based on the following assumptions:

    * The implementation is based on the |FF-A| standard.
    * Trusted boot is enabled. This means an attacker canâ€™t boot arbitrary images that are not approved by platform
      providers.
    * Each trusted service is running in an S-EL0 secure partition. Access to memory and hardware is controlled by the
      SPM based on the FF-A manifest or FF-A framework messages.
    * Components running at higher privilege levels than S-EL0 are to be inherently trusted. (I.e. the SPM).

Data flow diagram
-----------------

The data flow diagram visualizes the connection between components and where the data flow crosses security boundaries.

    * - DF6, DF7
      - Trusted Services interacts with shared hardware.
      - Yes
    * - DF8
      - Trusted Service interacts with dedicated peripheral interface.
      - Yes
    * - DF9, DF10
      - Trusted Service interacts with shared, external hardware.
      - Yes
    * - DF11
      - Trusted Service interacts with dedicated, external hardware.
      - Yes
    * - DF12
      - NWd interacts with more privileged software.

      - No
    * - DF14
      - Trusted Service interacts with dedicated, physically protected hardware.
      - Yes

It is worth highlighting two different dataflow types between the service and its clients:
    1. Direct communication through shared memory. DF1 and DF5 represents this type of communication and it may be
       sensitive to TOCTTOU attacks. See threat 10 below.
    2. Indirect communication through registers. DF2 and DF3 represents this type. This type is more secure and less
       performant.

.. _generic_threat_priority:

Threat Priority
---------------

Threat priority calculation is based on `Common Vulnerability Scoring System`_ (CVSS) Version 3.1. The threat priority
is represented by the `Severity Rating Scale`_ calculated from the CVSS score of each threat. The CVSS score is
calculated using the `Vulnerability Calculator`_.

For each threat the priority and a link to CVSS calculator capturing the calculator settings will be listed.

.. _generic_threat_types:

Threat Types
------------

In this threat model we categorize threats using the `STRIDE threat analysis technique`_. In this technique a threat is
categorized as one or more of these types: ``Spoofing``, ``Tampering``, ``Repudiation``, ``Information disclosure``,
``Denial of service`` or ``Elevation of privilege``.
