Deployments
===========
In the context of the Trusted Services project, a deployment represents a build of an
assembly of components that is intended to run within a specific environment. Some
deployments may be built for different platforms using platform specific components
if needed. The concept of a deployment is general purpose and can be applied to building
a wide range of targets such as secure partition images, user-space tools, shared libraries
and test executables.

Supported deployments are described on the following pages:
