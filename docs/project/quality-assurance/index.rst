Quality Assurance
=================

This section covers quality definition of the project, efforts the project is making to ensure the quality level of the
products meet expectations.

The primary products of this project are the :ref:`Deployments` building :ref:`Secure Partition Images` and `Libraries`.
There are secondary products like:

  - build scripts
  - test automation scripts
  - documentation
  - various processes
  - etc...

Quality Assurance of secondary products happens at a "best effort" basis. The project will try to keep these healthy,
but quality definition of these may aim lower or may even be lacking.
