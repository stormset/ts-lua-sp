Platform Certification
======================
Various certification programmes exist to help platform vendors produce hardware
and firmware that meets defined requirements for security and feature compatibility.
By conforming to a set of testable criteria, platform vendors can make assurances to
customers about the capabilities and security of their products.

The Trusted Services project is an upstream source for service related components
that can be integrated into platform firmware. Many of these components are important
building blocks for meeting certification requirements. Reuse of components by
downstream platform integration projects will help drive quality and security
improvements, especially in areas covered by relevant certification programmes.

Currently, the following certification programmes have been adopted by downstream
platform integration projects:
